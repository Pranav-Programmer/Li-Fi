>>>>In this model, we transferred messages from our mobile phones to LCD using light as a data transmitter. We used the frequency and duration of the flashlight to transmit the message through a solar panel. We made an application that take the message as an input and gives the flashlight as output which is reflected on the LDR sensor and the corresponding message is displayed on the LCD. We used Arduino Uno as the microcontroller board.

>>>>>We transferred the image after burning the code in the transmitter and receiver which are Arduino nano. After burning the code in the transmitter, we used cool term software and take the required file type and the command is passed into the LED which will blink accordingly on the solar panel and pass the data into the receiver which processes the data and display the image onto the LCD.
