# Li-Fi
Li-Fi, which is light fidelity, is one of the future technologies in the wireless
communication sector. It is bidirectional, with a very high speed and is a
fully networked communication which is wireless technology similar to
Wi-Fi. In the present era, Wi-Fi is the most trending domain. As internet
users almost double every year, there is an enormous load on the radio
spectrum that leads to congestion. To get better bandwidth, efficiency and
speed, a new technology Li-Fi has evolved.. Li-Fi can be simply put to be
Wi-Fi but instead of radio waves light is used as a medium. Here, data is
transmitted using light whose intensity varies faster than the human eye
can capture. Instead of using modems, Li-Fi uses LED bulbs with
transceivers. Data transmission in Li-Fi is about 100 times faster than
Wi-Fi. Here, in this paper we explore the need for Li-Fi. Li-Fi technology,
proposed by the German Scientist â€” Harald Haas, Harald Haas proposed
the technology that transmits the data through illumination .Li-Fi is ideal for
high speed wireless data transmission in confined areas. Li-Fi provides
higher bandwidth, efficiency, availability and security than Wi-Fi and has
already achieved high speed in the lab. We can implement this system for
public internet access through street lamps to auto -piloted cars that
communicate through their headlights. As the speed of light is higher hence
the data transmission speed is so much faster that the existing system. In
the future we can implement this technology for fast data access for the
laptops, smart phones, and tablets that will be transmitted through the light
in a room.

>>We transferred the image after burning the code in the transmitter and receiver which are Arduino nano. After burning the code in the transmitter, we used cool term software and take the required file type and the command is passed into the LED which will blink accordingly on the solar panel and pass the data into the receiver which processes the data and display the image onto the LCD.

>>>In this model, we transferred messages from our mobile phones to LCD using light as a data transmitter. We used the frequency and duration of the flashlight to transmit the message through a solar panel. We made an application that take the message as an input and gives the flashlight as output which is reflected on the LDR sensor and the corresponding message is displayed on the LCD. We used Arduino Uno as the microcontroller board.
